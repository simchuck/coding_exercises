-- 5. Create a list of all Customers sorted by Region and put customers with Null Region 
-- value at the beginning (not at the end). By default Null values are at the end. So, 
-- you have to create a new column HasRegion (0/1) with CASE statement and Order By two 
-- columns: HasRegion and Region.
SELECT 
	region, companyname,
(CASE 
	WHEN region IS NULL THEN
		0
	ELSE
		1
	END) AS HasRegion
FROM customers
ORDER BY HasRegion, Region
